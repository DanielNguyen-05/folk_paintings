    "evaluation": "This evaluation focuses on the single provided response, Response A, assessing its suitability as an outpainting configuration for the Vietnamese Đông Hồ woodblock print, \"The Rat's Wedding.\"\n\n## Evaluation of Response A (gemini_stage1)\n\n**1. Completeness and validity of JSON structure**\nThe JSON structure is complete, valid, and adheres to the required format (`task_type`, `expansion_settings`, `context_awareness`, `scenarios`).\n\n**2. Quality and detail of `expansion_settings`**\n*   `task_type`: \"outpainting\" is correct.\n*   `direction`: \"all\" is appropriate for expanding the context around the central narrative.\n*   `pixel_amount`: 512 is a good size for significant but manageable expansion.\n*   `mask_blur`: 25 is a reasonable setting, though the blending must respect the distinct, heavy outlines characteristic of woodblock prints.\n\n**3. Appropriateness of `context_awareness` settings**\nThis section is exceptionally strong and demonstrates expert knowledge of the source material.\n*   `original_style`: Accurately identifies the style as \"Vietnamese Đông Hồ woodblock print,\" names the specific piece (\"Đám cưới chuột - The Rat's Wedding\"), details the medium (\"textured Dó paper (giấy điệp) with seashell powder\"), and correctly describes the key visual features (\"bold, heavy black outlines,\" \"limited palette of natural mineral and plant pigments\").\n*   `seamless_blending_keywords`: Excellent selection of technical and material keywords (\"Đông Hồ woodcut aesthetic,\" \"coarse, off-white paper texture (*giấy điệp*),\" \"heavy black contour lines,\" \"flat, stylized color blocking\"). These keywords are essential for maintaining the authenticity of the generated expansion.\n\n**4. Creativity and variety of scenarios**\nThe scenarios are highly creative, contextually relevant, and offer diverse settings (rural architecture, natural landscape, bustling market, interior dwelling).\n*   **Scenario 1 (village_gate_approach):** Uses iconic Vietnamese architectural and natural elements (*cổng làng*, *cây đa*), which perfectly frames the procession.\n*   **Scenario 2 (lotus_pond_crossing):** Introduces a natural element (*hồ sen*) and addresses how reflections and water should be stylized in this specific art form.\n*   **Scenario 3 (tet_market_scene):** Broadens the cultural scope by placing the event during the Tết celebration, requiring the generation of new, stylized figures (vendors, onlookers) and symbolic items (lanterns, kumquats).\n*   **Scenario 4 (mandarin_quarters_interior):** Focuses on the destination and the satirical meaning of the piece (the cat symbolizing authority), requiring the generation of stylized interior elements (furniture, calligraphy, altar).\n\n**5. Overall coherence and implementation readiness**\nThe configuration is highly coherent. The detailed style description combined with culturally specific and visually diverse scenarios ensures that any generated output will be authentic and meaningful. The prompts are well-written, containing strong constraints to guide the generative model toward the correct aesthetic. This response is ready for implementation.\n\n---\n## Final Selection\n\nBEST RESPONSE: Response A",
