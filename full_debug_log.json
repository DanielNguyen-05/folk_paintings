Evaluation Summary\n\n| Feature | Response A (Stage 1) | Response B (Stage 2 - gpt_stage2) | Response C (Stage 2 - gemini_stage2) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **JSON Validity** | Valid | Valid | Valid |\n| **Expansion Settings** | Appropriate (768px, all direction) | Identical to A | Identical to A |\n| **Context Awareness** | Strong (Đông Hồ, limited palette, dó paper) | Identical to A | **Excellent** (Identifies specific pigments, mentions the print title, adds \"flat graphic perspective,\" and \"satirical\" nature.) |\n| **Scenario Creativity/Refinement** | Good, general scenarios. | Identical to A | **Excellent** (Incorporates specific Vietnamese cultural terms: *nhà tranh*, *đình*, *hoa đào*, *Phúc* character, *mây* motifs, making prompts highly focused.) |\n| **Comparison (Refinement)**| Baseline | No change/No refinement | **Significant Improvement**. Deepened cultural specificity in both context and prompts. |\n\n### 2. Detailed Comparison and Selection\n\n**Response A (Initial Draft):** This response correctly identifies the style as Đông Hồ and uses appropriate keywords like \"dó paper\" and \"thick black outlines.\" It establishes a solid foundation.\n\n**Response B (Refined Version 1):** This response is an exact duplicate of Response A. It fails to show any refinement or improvement.\n\n**Response C (Refined Version 2):** This response is superior due to its meticulous attention to cultural detail:\n1.  **Style Definition:** The `original_style` description is elevated by naming the specific natural pigments (cinnabar red, malachite green) and explicitly referencing the print's content (\"Đám cưới chuột\").\n2.  **Blending Keywords:** It adds \"flat graphic perspective\" and \"satirical procession scene,\" ensuring the AI understands the stylistic constraints and the narrative tone.\n3.  **Prompt Specificity:** The scenarios are much stronger. Instead of just \"traditional houses,\" it specifies *nhà tranh* (thatched houses). Instead of just \"symbolic elements,\" it specifies *hoa đào* (peach blossoms), kumquat trees, and the *Phúc* character—all highly specific Tết iconography. This level of detail is critical for achieving a truly authentic and seamless result.\n\nResponse C successfully leverages domain-specific knowledge to provide highly effective instructions, making it the most likely configuration to yield a museum-quality outpainting result.\n\n### 3.
