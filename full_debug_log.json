    "evaluation": "This image is a classic example of Vietnamese **Đông Hồ folk woodcut print** (Tranh Đông Hồ), specifically the satirical \"Đám cưới chuột\" (The Rat's Wedding). A successful outpainting configuration must recognize and strictly adhere to the stylistic constraints of this medium: bold, blocky black outlines, flat perspective, limited color palette (red, yellow, green, black) derived from natural pigments, and the rough texture of Dó paper.\n\n### Evaluation Summary\n\n| Response | JSON Validity | Expansion Settings | Context Awareness (Đông Hồ Specificity) | Creativity/Scenarios | Overall Quality |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **A** | Yes | Fine (300px) | Poor (Too generic \"Asian art\") | Generic fantasy | Low |\n| **B** | Yes | Good (400px) | Fair (Still generic \"Asian folk art\") | Culturally inconsistent (Cherry blossoms, fairies) | Medium |\n| **C** | Yes | Good (450px) | Excellent (Names Đông Hồ, Dó paper, pigments) | Highly relevant (Bamboo, thatched roofs) | High |\n| **D** | Yes | Excellent (512px, 12 blur) | Excellent (Names Đông Hồ, Dó paper, bold outlines) | Narrative-focused, accurate setting | High |\n| **E** | Yes | Excellent (512px, 10 blur) | Excellent (Detailed style description) | Good, but slightly over-detailed (\"intricately detailed,\" \"cheerful villagers\") | High |\n| **F** | Yes | Excellent (512px, 12 blur) | **Superior** (Names specific pigments, \"heavy, blocky black outlines,\" uses Vietnamese terms) | Highly focused, technically precise, and culturally deep | **Superior** |\n\n### Detailed Rationale for Selection\n\nResponses A and B are immediately disqualified for failing to identify the specific Vietnamese Đông Hồ style, instead opting for broad \"Asian folk art\" descriptions, leading to inappropriate scenarios (cherry blossoms, jungles, fairies).\n\nResponses C, D, E, and F are all strong candidates because they correctly identify the Đông Hồ woodcut technique.\n\n1.  **Response C** is accurate but the scenarios are general village scenes.\n2.  **Response D** provides an excellent, narrative-driven structure (procession origin, tiger setting, rural landscape).\n3.  **Response E** refines D but introduces potentially contradictory descriptors like \"intricately detailed,\" which works against the flat, simple aesthetic of the woodcut.\n4.  **Response F** is the most refined and expert configuration. It builds on the strong narrative structure of D but enhances the **Context Awareness** and **Prompt Quality** significantly:\n    *   **Technical Specificity:** It uses expert language like \"heavy, blocky black outlines,\" \"Cánh gián red pigment,\" and \"flat color blocks,\" ensuring the generative model understands the technical constraints of the woodcut medium.\n    *   **Cultural Specificity:** It incorporates Vietnamese terms like *mái ngói* (tiled roof), *ruộng lúa* (rice paddies), and *cổng làng* (village gate) directly into the prompts, guaranteeing the expansion remains culturally authentic.\n    *   **Seamless Blending:** The final panoramic prompt is comprehensive, demanding flawless imitation of the exact texture, color scheme, and perspective.\n\nResponse F provides the highest level of technical guidance necessary for an AI to successfully replicate a specific, traditional folk art style.\n\nBEST RESPONSE: Response F",
