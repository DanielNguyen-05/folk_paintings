    "evaluation": "The image provided is a classic example of **Tranh Đông Hồ (Đông Hồ woodblock prints)**, a highly specific form of Vietnamese folk art, often depicting themes like the \"Rat's Wedding\" (Đám cưới chuột) which carries social commentary. The style is defined by thick black outlines, flat color fields (often using natural pigments like red, yellow, and green), and the texture of the Dó paper.\n\n## Evaluation of Responses\n\n### Response A (gpt_stage1)\n\n| Criterion | Evaluation |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **JSON Structure** | Valid and complete. |\n| **Expansion Settings** | Generic (`400` pixels, `mask_blur: 3`). Acceptable but not optimized. |\n| **Context Awareness** | **Poor.** The style description (\"traditional Asian folk art\") is far too generic. It completely misses the crucial details of the woodblock printing technique, the specific Vietnamese cultural context, and the Dó paper texture. |\n| **Scenarios** | **Weak/Inappropriate.** Scenarios like \"An enchanted forest filled with mythical creatures\" are generic fantasy themes that do not align with the traditional, socio-cultural context of Đông Hồ prints. The prompts lack specific technical constraints (outlines, flat color) necessary for authentic expansion. |\n| **Overall Coherence** | Low. This configuration would likely result in a digitally painted, generic expansion that loses the unique aesthetic and cultural identity of the original woodblock print. |\n\n### Response B (gemini_stage1)\n\n| Criterion | Evaluation |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **JSON Structure** | Valid and complete, with descriptive scenario IDs. |\n| **Expansion Settings** | Appropriate (`512` pixels, `mask_blur: 5`). |\n| **Context Awareness** | **Excellent.** It precisely identifies the style as \"Traditional Vietnamese Đông Hồ woodblock print style (Tranh Đông Hồ),\" detailing the key characteristics: thick black outlines, flat color blocking, natural pigments, and visible Dó paper texture. |\n| **Scenarios** | **Outstanding.** All scenarios are culturally and contextually specific to a Vietnamese village setting and the theme of the Rat's Wedding procession. They include specific elements like the banyan tree (cây đa), communal house (đình), rice paddies, and feudal architecture, ensuring thematic continuity. Crucially, every prompt explicitly reinforces the need to maintain the \"Đông Hồ woodblock print style.\" |\n| **Overall Coherence** | High. This configuration is technically precise and culturally sensitive, providing all necessary constraints (stylistic, material, and thematic) to generate an authentic and seamless expansion. |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nResponse B demonstrates expert knowledge of the source material, accurately identifying the specific art form (Đông Hồ woodblock print) and incorporating the necessary technical details (Dó paper texture, thick outlines, flat colors) into both the context awareness and the scenario prompts. Response A is too generic to produce a high-quality, authentic result.\n\nBEST RESPONSE: Response B",
